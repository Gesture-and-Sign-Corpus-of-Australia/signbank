## Deployment

Signbank has been developed for the Australian Research Data Common's cloud, [Nectar](https://ardc.edu.au/services/ardc-nectar-research-cloud/). The deployment scripts should work out-of-the-box with any other OpenStack cloud (a popular choice for national research infrastructure, some universities have their own OS cloud as well).
